# Practicing Forking and Pull Requests

For this project, you should fork the repository at https://github.com/ine-rmotr-projects/Fractal which was created in the previous lesson. In order to do this you will need to create an account and setup your security credentials. If you already have a GitHub account, you may have performed some of the steps already.

After that, you will create separate branches corresponding to the numbered directories, make some changes and propose that changes to the original repository using a Pull Request.

Start with the Notebook `Project.ipynb`, and best of luck!
